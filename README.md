## What is sim-C?

<p align="justify">Often people have trouble programming in C (especially beginners) due to its low level syntax and availability of stable third party libraries. We present sim-C a high-level front end for C which creates a dynamically typed syntax for C. User can write code in this high level syntax and then compile it to optimized C code. sim-C does not process the code and simply translates it to C thus, there is no possibility of the code running slowly. So, with sim-C users can write code faster using the high level syntax and at the same time be able to harness the power and speed of a C program. Let us make C cool again.</p>
